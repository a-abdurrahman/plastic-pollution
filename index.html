          <h2>Plastic Pollution</h2>
          <img src="assets/images/Lepidochelys_olivacea_Landaa.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and
            particles in Earth's environment that has negative effects on
            humans, wildlife, and their habitat. Plastic is an inexpensive and
            durable material, which makes them suitable for many use cases.
            However, plastics are so durable that they degrade slowly, which
            causes them to take up space in the landfill. Through littering and
            waste mismanagement, plastics find their way into the ecosystem,
            polluting it.

          <h2>Types of Plastic Waste</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Macroplastics</h3>
            <p>
              Plastic debris larger than 20 mm is categorized as macroplastic
              waste. Fishing nets can trap marine animals and other plastic
              waste, forming a large mass up to 6 tons.

            <h3>Microplastics</h3>
            <p>
              Microplastics are plastic debris ranging from 5 mm to 2 mm.
              Macroplastics can break and degrade into microplastics. These
              microplastics can accumulate in the oceans and allow for the
              accumulation of persistent bioaccumulating toxins such as
              bisphenol A, polystyrene, DDT, and PCB's, which are hydrophobic in
              nature and can cause adverse health effects.

          <section>
            <h3>Impact of plastic pollution on land</h3>
            <p>
              It is estimated that the plastic concentration on land can be as
              much as twenty-three times that of the ocean. Plastic pollution on
              land can cause harm to all sorts of plants and animals, including
              humans who live on land. For example, chlorinated plastic can
              release dangerous chemicals that seep into water sources and
              endanger species that depend on it. Plastic waste can also clog
              sewers, which increases the risks of flooding.

            <h3>Impact of plastic pollution on marine animals</h3>
            <p>
              As can be seen on the news, marine life is severely affected by
              plastic pollution. Seabirds, whales, turtles, and fish mistake
              plastic waste for prey and then die of starvation because their
              stomachs are filled with plastic. Globally, 100,000 marine mammals
              die every year as a result of plastic pollution. This includes
              whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions.

          <h2>Top plastic polluters</h2>
          <p>
            Around 275 million metric tons of plastic waste are generated each
            year around the world; between 4.8 million and 12.7 million metric
            tons are dumped into the sea. The table below lists the top 20
            plastic waste-polluting countries in 2019 according to a study
            published by Science, Jambeck et al. (2021). and processed by Our
            World In Data.
